# Advent of Code 2025, C++ edition
By Jennifer Gott @simbachu

## About

This year I am doing Advent of Code in Go. However, I was missing doing C++ so I thought I would port over some of it for fun.

The idea is to take the basic skeleton from the Go version and just adapt some of the stuff I like from C++. I have no intent to make this "faster" or such. I just really like how C++ looks and feels.
